  <h1>About the Author and His Journey</h1>

  <p>Bryan Quoc Le, Ph.D. is the founder and CEO of Mendosyn Bio, a biotechnology company redesigning psychedelic compounds as tools to catalyze inner healing, personal growth, and community development. He earned his doctorate in food science from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, where he studied the enzyme-driven biosynthesis of medicinal compounds from plant-based sources. He also holds a B.S. and M.S. in Chemistry from the University of California, Irvine.</p>

  <p>Dr. Le’s journey into altered states of consciousness began when he walked from California to Louisiana over the course of six months as a 2,000-mile spiritual pilgrimage, relying solely on the generosity of others for sustenance. Inspired by the sudden passing of his father during college and attendance of Burning Man the following year, the experiences imprinted on him the fundamental importance of direct human connection across all divisions to bring about societal shifts in consciousness.</p>

  <p>Upon his return, he briefly attended Stanford University to pursue a dual degree program for a PhD in Chemistry and MS in Medicine, but shortly withdrew from the two programs after experiencing an acute bout of clinical major depression and battling the condition for a decade.</p>

  <p>After completing his doctorate in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, he founded a boutique consultancy to offer his scientific skills, knowledge, and insights to venture-backed startups and companies in the food, beverage, and supplement industries. Dr. Le also published his first book for general audiences, <em>150 Food Science Questions Answered</em>, in the same year.</p>

  <p>He serves as the host of the upcoming short documentary on the science of flavors, <em>The Flavor Matrix</em>, directed and produced by Emmy award-winning documentarian and visual media artist, Christopher Brannan and Diana Reichenbach. He currently holds three patents and is pursuing his fourth in the technology driving Mendosyn Bio.</p>

  <p>The founding of Mendosyn Bio was inspired by Dr. Le’s personal journey towards healing and wholeness after struggling with depression for many years. His own transformations were accelerated by the death of his mother in 2024, after she was hit by a car while on her bicycle. He envisions a world where individuals suffering from mental health disorders can freely access the same tools he did for healing, without prejudice, fear, or shame.</p>
